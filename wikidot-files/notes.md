+++ Product Notes
* Need to appeal to mass consumer market (not just techy/high ed)
* Starting w/techy might be good strat, need roll-out strategy aka Facebook.  Try infiltrating large, local high-tech co's (amazon, microsoft, google, nintendo)
* May want to do blogging/comments aka reddit
* Need better name
* Key is mobile.  Also key is desktop
* Focus on making it easy.
* Follow the story
* "heard it first on ..."

* Google scans news sites. What gets you into trouble is attribution.  I.e. don't display the stories as your own, display links to them.  Become the networks largest redirector.
