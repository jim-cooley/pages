A sophisticated monitoring-as-a-service offering from Google.

#### Interesting Features:
* graphs show statistics: min, max, mean, & deviation
* integration with Google BigQuery & Datalab, giving access to underlying raw data
* supports DIRECT Python integration -- open an IPython Notebood and start coding away.  Can access the time-series data
as a Pandas DataFrame.
