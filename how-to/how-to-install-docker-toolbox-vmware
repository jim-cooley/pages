#Installing Docker Toolbox with VMWare Fusion for OSX

Docker Machine is a host 'stub' that works in conjunction with a virtual-machine manager to enable 
Docker to run on OSX as OSX cannot run Docker natively.  The default way to se this up is with 
'Docker Machine' (this replaces Boot2Docker) and this has all been packaged nicely together into
something called 'Docker Toolbox'.  

Today, we're going to modify this so that it will install all of the above, but also add the
stub to use VMWare Fusion instead of Virtualbox as the VM Host.  The reason for this is that
VMWare Fusion provides higher performance than Virtualbox when doing nested container operations 
such as this.

###Step 1: Install VMWare Fusion

###Step 2: Install Docker Toolbox
Docker Toolbox can be installed from soure, or from the release downloads folder, or ... using 
the OSX Package manager, ```brew```.  We'll use ```brew``` as it streamlines this process and enables
auto-updating.  I checked and as of this writing, ```brew``` was installing the latest release of
Docker, so there's no penalty from that perspetive in going this route.

To verify for yourself:
```
brew cask info dockertoolbox
brew info docker-machine
brew info docker
```
